                    <br>We love to help our customers, reach their goals by giving the best support possible. 
                  <br><br>  TopNotchFitness was founded in 2005 by Eugene Simmons who started off at a solid 240 lbs. 
                <br>He always thought that he could do much better at keeping his health intact but he just needed the right 
                motivation.
                <br> <br>
                As he went to try and find the right way for him to lose weight and gain muscle as well,
                 he thought 
                everyone loves a good gym but you also need a trainer. <br> This created the idea for TopNotchFitness. He wanted to help others achieve what he knew was a common goal in life, which he considered weight loss. 
                Eugene then took the neccersary steps to turn his vision into a reality. 
                Today there are several TopNotchFitness gyms all across the country. There have also been rumors of 
                them going international!   <br>
